  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <h2>Learning HTML from Scratch</h2>
  <h3>Project by Benedict</h3>

  <p>This is my very first attempt at writing a full HTML webpage. It's both fun and educational!</p>
  <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the backbone of the web.</p>
  <p>I'm learning how to structure pages using headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>
  <p>Eventually, I'll combine HTML with CSS and JavaScript to build full-featured web applications.</p>
